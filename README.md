Overview This documentation provides insights into a FastAPI application designed for handling document uploads, processing web URLs, managing Q&A pairs, and storing data in a Pinecone vector store. The application leverages OpenAI models for generating embeddings and responses. Required Libraries The application uses several libraries, including but not limited to:
1. langchain
2. langchain-community
3. pinecone
4. ChatOpenAI
5. langsmith
6. fastapi
7. unstructured
8. RetrievalQA
9. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
10. PineconeHybridSearchRetriever
11. openai

# Application Configuration
FastAPI Initialization The FastAPI application is initialized with the following parameters:

CORS Middleware CORS is enabled for all origins, allowing cross-origin requests.
origins = ["*"]
app.add_middleware(
CORSMiddleware,
allow_origins=origins,
allow_credentials=True,
allow_methods=["*"],
allow_headers=["*"])

# Environment Variables
Environment variables are loaded using dotenv, which includes keys for OpenAI and Pinecone. If the Pinecone API key is missing, the application prompts the user to enter it.
Pinecone Initialization
Checks for existing Pinecone indexes and creates one if it does not exist, specifying dimensions and metrics.
